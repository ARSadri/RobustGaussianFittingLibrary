""" fit a Gaussian to recover vector value, lines, plane,...
Input arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    MSSE_LAMBDA : How far (normalized by STD of the Gaussian) from the 
                        mean of the Gaussian, data is considered inlier.
                        default: 3.0
    topKthPerc: A rough but certain guess of portion of inliers, between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.5. 
                    Choose the topKthPerc to be as high as you are sure the portion of data is inlier.
                    if you are not sure at all, you have a problem of estimating structure size
                    That can be solved by the MCNC method which develops covariance of data. 
                    One simpler solution (that maybe slower and less accurate) is to try many and 
                    ensemble the models by their median.
                default : 0.5
    bottomKthPerc : set it to 0.9*topKthPerc, 
                    if N is number of data points, then make sure that
                    (topKthPerc - bottomKthPerc)*N>p+4 [RuwanAliTPAMI16], where p is 
                    number of parameters of the model, 
                    p_valuefitting = 1
                    p_linefitting = 2
                    p_planefitting = 3
                    it is best if bottomKthPerc*N>12 then MSSE makes sense
                    otherwise the code returns non-robust results.

        inMask: where 0 is bad and 1 is good. The masked pixels have not effect in the calculation of the parameters of the plane fit to background. However, the value of the background at their location can be found.
        minRes: minimum distance to the center of the image
            default: 0
        maxRes: maximum distance to the center of the image
        shellWidth : the ring around the center can have a width and a value will be fitted to
                all calue in the ring.
        finiteSampleBias : size of an area on a ring will be downsampled evenly to no more than finiteSampleBias

                    to Newton method
            default : 12
        MSSE_LAMBDA : How far (normalized by STD of the Gaussian) from the 
                        mean of the Gaussian, data is considered inlier.
                        default: 3.0

        stride: by giving a shellWidth>1, one can desire convolving the shell over radius by
